## Overview

This app was designed as a clone of the well-known flashcard-based website, [Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com//).  However there is one key difference.  Lingoscape is designed specifically to help users learn new languages through language-based flashcards.  These flashcards are available for use by anyone.  If one would like to contribute a new set of language flashcards to the database, they would have to first create an account.  Studies have shown that studying through spaced repetition often leads to more efficient long-term memory, so this would be a perfect app for both casual and serious language learners.

## Application Architecture
Lingoscape was created utilizing Flask, Python, PostgreSQL database, and SQLAlchemy for the backend, and React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for frontend.  Npm package "react-responsive-carousel" was implemented for homepage image slider as well as for the mechanism to peruse through a deck of flashcards.

## Future Implementations
I would like to expand on the user page:
* Allow user to upload or link a profile pictures to replace default profile picture.
* Allow user to change password and/or email.

I'd also like to implement a "favorite" or "currently studying" feature that allows a user to add decks from other users/self to the dashboard.  The user would be able to add/remove decks to/from the "favorites" collection at any time.
